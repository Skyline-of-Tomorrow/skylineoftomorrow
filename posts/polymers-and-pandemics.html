								  <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: 500">
									  The future of the Earth’s population is one of increased urbanization.
									  It is predicted that <a style="color: #6633ff" href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/en/news/population/2018-revision-of-world-urbanization-prospects.html">
										by 2050 approximately 68% of people on earth will live in urban areas.</a> This trend in population movement will be accompanied
									  by a trend in development as cities expand systems, build new
									  housing, and create new neighborhoods. This trend will also bring
									  about a new slate of challenges for urban infrastructure and
									  planning. One of these challenges is a predicted increase in
									  the frequency of global pandemics.</p>
						      <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: 500">
								    Increasing population density contributes to a faster rate of
									  pandemic disease spread and a higher rate of pathogen mutation,
									  due to increased rates of transmission between host vectors.
									  Combine this risk with the fact that population density increase
									  outpaces the creation of necessary new sanitation and healthcare
									  systems, and <a style="color: #6633ff" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971215001836">
										it creates the conditions for an increase in pandemics in the future.</a></p>
								  <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: 500">
									  While advances in biotechnology hope to devise cures in response
									  to disease, it will only go so far to mitigate the effects of
									  future pandemics. Knowing that pandemics will occur with more
									  frequency implies a need to improve pandemic prevention systems.
									  The future of urban planning must incorporate changes in preventative
									  sanitation and healthcare systems.</p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: 500">
									  The field of <a style="color: #6633ff" href="https://academic.oup.com/jsh/article-abstract/13/1/83/966902?redirectedFrom=fulltext">
										urban planning traces its origins to the development
									  of sanitation </a> infrastructure to respond to epidemics occurring
									  throughout the 17th century. It was during a series of Cholera
									  outbreaks in London during the <a style="color: #6633ff" href="https://oyc.yale.edu/history/hist-234/lecture-11">1830s-1850s</a>
										that the <a style="color: #6633ff" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/09/the-illusion-of-natural/380836/">“filth theory”</a>
									  of disease spread gained peak popularity. The filth theory posited
									  that disease tended to emerge and spread fastest in the presence
									  of dense amounts of pollution, sewage, and filth. Preventing
									  the accumulation of filth in the name of stopping the spread
									  of disease served as the foundational principle for the creation
									  of early sanitation systems. This ultimately necessitated urban
									  planning. Prior to the sanitation revolution most urban planning
									  was privatized and random. Buildings would arise per the dictates
									  of those with the money to build. Most sanitation systems were
									  private at the time and uncoordinated as a result. The sanitation
									  revolution encouraged the creation of building codes to coordinate
									  systems, the creation of survey planning to improve system
									  efficiency, and the implementation of water-carriage sewerage.
									  <a style="color: #6633ff" href="https://academic.oup.com/jsh/article-abstract/13/1/83/966902?redirectedFrom=fulltext">Sanitary reformers functioned as de facto urban planners</a>
										at a time when the urban planning profession did not exist.</p>
								  <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: 500">
									  The sanitation revolution helped prevent further epidemics.
									  Water-borne pandemics and epidemics are <a style="color: #6633ff" href="https://academic.oup.com/jsh/article-abstract/13/1/83/966902?redirectedFrom=fulltext">rare in urban environments
									  with high quality sanitation systems.</a> Since the advent of the
									  sanitation revolution changes have taken place in our modern
									  sanitation systems. Technology has been updated based on newer
									  studies and more comprehensive survey data has enabled better
									  planning. One way in which modern innovation can help to update
									  existing sanitation systems is through the incorporation of
									  advanced materials.</p>
								  <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: 500">
									  The SARS-CoV2 Pandemic, which causes COVID-19, has shown how
									  rapidly contagious disease can spread within a globalized
									  population. <a style="color: #6633ff" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html">Early precautions</a>
										against the viral spread focused
									  primarily on reducing contact with the virus via hand washing
									  and wiping down surfaces. This was meant to target one of the
									  primary modes of viral transmission in modern society: contact
									  with fomites, which are surfaces carrying live contagious
									  microbes. A sanitation system preparing for the future of
									  pandemics could focus on redesigning fomites to minimize
									  contagion exposure. One method of redesigning surfaces could
									  be to modify their material composition to enhance antimicrobial
									  properties, thus making surfaces de facto self-cleaning and
									  preventing fomite infection.</p>
								  <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: 500">
									  The use of antimicrobial materials is not new. Around the same
									  time as the first sanitation systems were created, physician
									  <a style="color: #6633ff" href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xgqkyw/copper-destroys-viruses-and-bacteria-why-isnt-it-everywhere">Victor Burq was studying the mysteriously low rate of cholera
									  infection among copper miners.</a> Burq’s conclusion was that copper
									  had a preventative effect on the spread of cholera. Incorporating
									  antimicrobial materials, such as copper, could significantly
									  reduce fomite infection. A clinical trial run across three
									  hospitals determined that when enveloping the most contaminated
									  surfaces closest to a patient in copper, the microbial presence
									  on these surfaces was <a style="color: #6633ff" href="https://jcm.asm.org/content/50/7/2217">reduced 83% resulting in a 58% reduction</a>
									  in Healthcare Associated Infections (HAIs).</p>
								  <blockquote style="font-size: 2em; line-height: 1.5em">Thus, the current challenge, to integrate antimicrobial
									materials into existing construction and design frameworks,
									advancing these production models to enable a sanitation system
									for tomorrow.</blockquote>
								  <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: 500">
									  Unfortunately, the use of copper in construction <a style="color: #6633ff" href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xgqkyw/copper-destroys-viruses-and-bacteria-why-isnt-it-everywhere">fell out of
									  style</a>, <a style="color: #6633ff" href="https://theconversation.com/copper-is-great-at-killing-superbugs-so-why-dont-hospitals-use-it-73103">with cheaper</a>
										and more aesthetically pleasing plastic
									  and steel incorporated into modern design. Plastic and steel,
									  however, lack the antimicrobial properties of copper. When it
									  comes to coronaviruses studies have indicated copper’s
									  effectiveness at killing the virus in comparison to other
									  materials. Whereas SARS-CoV2 can last several days on plastic
									  and stainless steel and a full day on cardboard, when on copper,
									  the virus <a style="color: #6633ff" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033217v1.full.pdf">only lasts four hours</a>
										maximum.  Thus, the current challenge, to integrate antimicrobial materials into existing
									  construction and design frameworks, advancing these production
									  models to enable a sanitation system for tomorrow.</p>
								  <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: 500">
									  Innovations in polymer science allow for the creation of <a style="color: #6633ff" href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/bm061150q">more
									  efficient antimicrobial materials</a>, and scientists are <a style="color: #6633ff" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6017335/">developing
									  innovative means</a> of implementing these materials into existing
									  systems. New materials incorporating biocidal agents into
									  <a style="color: #6633ff" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/homopolymers">homopolymers</a>
										(polymers composed of one type of monomer),
									  <a style="color: #6633ff" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/copolymer">copolymers</a>
										(polymers composed of multiple types of monomers),
									  and <a style="color: #6633ff" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemistry/nanocomposite">nanocomposites</a>
										(materials composed of multiple polymers)
									  can emphasize the antimicrobial properties while varying
									  mechanical properties, allowing for more diverse applications.</p>
								  <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: 500">
									  Antimicrobial polymers are especially useful since they are
									  adaptable to various surfaces with a range of mechanical properties.
									  They are very industry applicable as they can be fabricated
									  using <a style="color: #6633ff" href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/bm061150q">various techniques.</a>
										One fabrication technique involves adding a biocidal agent after processing of the polymer.
									  Another technique involves adding a biocidal agent to the
									  polymer during processing, which can itself be done through
									  multiple methods.</p>
								  <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: 500">
									  The first method is through the polymerizing or copolymerizing
									  of a biocidal monomer. <a style="color: #6633ff" href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/bm061150q">Acrylic types of pharmaceutical drugs</a>
									  are frequently used as monomer units for this method. Polymerizing
									  the acrylic type of the common herbicide, Dichlorophenol,
									  researchers developed homopolymers and co-polymers of 2,4-dichlorophenyl
									  acrylate (2,4-DMA), which resulted in an <a style="color: #6633ff" href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/bm061150q">72-80%</a> reduction in
									  bacterial growth and <a style="color: #6633ff" href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/bm061150q">72-82% reduction</a> in fungal and yeast growth.
									  Copolymerization of <a style="color: #6633ff" href="https://goldbook.iupac.org/terms/view/O04291">Quaternary</a> monomers (QAMA) with 2-hydroxyethyl
									  methacrylate, a monomer known for easy polymerization, resulted
									  in <a style="color: #6633ff" href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/bm061150q">100% disinfection</a> in under 10 minutes when the QAMA content
									  in the copolymer was over 40%.</p>
								  <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: 500">
									  The second method is through covalently bonding antimicrobial
									  functional groups onto polymers through a process known as <a style="color: #6633ff" href="https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-3-662-44324-8_274">grafting.</a>
									  Quaternary ammonium compounds are disinfectant agents which
									  can be grafted onto polymers, enabling antimicrobial properties.
									  When Quaternary ammonium and Quaternary phosphonium groups were
									  grafted onto polymers, they allowed for these polymers to have
									  antimicrobial properties that resulted in <a style="color: #6633ff" href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/bm061150q">100% surface disinfection
									  in under 24 hours.</a> Silver ions can also be grafted onto polymer
									  fibers, resulting in enhanced antimicrobial activity. Silver,
									  along with the polymer <a style="color: #6633ff" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5037843/">Chitosan</a>, has been explored in the
									  context of creating organic antimicrobial polymers for use in
									  medicine and food preservation, due to their non-toxic nature.
									  Chitosan is a naturally occurring polymer derived from <a style="color: #6633ff" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6572373/">shrimp
									  and crab shells</a>, which can be chemically bound with other
									  polymers, via process known as <a style="color: #6633ff" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemistry/crosslinking">crosslinking, to form nanocomposites
									  for use in antimicrobial textiles. Chitosan, when modified,
									  can kill up to <a style="color: #6633ff" href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/bm061150q">100% of bacterial and fungal</a> presence on surfaces
									  in under 24 hours at concentrations as low as 10 milligrams
									  per milliliter.</p>
								  <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: 500">
									  Scientists aspire to achieve <a style="color: #6633ff" href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/bm061150q">certain characteristics</a> when
									  developing antimicrobial polymers that make industrial
									  production easier while maintaining practical application.
									  Polymers should be able to be easily and inexpensively
									  synthesized. They should remain stable over time and varying
									  temperatures. If the polymer is being created for use in liquids
									  it should not be soluble in the target liquids. The polymer
									  should be non-toxic and lack toxic byproducts to allow for
									  human handling. Ideally the polymer can regenerate itself and
									  maintain its antimicrobial properties upon loss of activity.
									  Most importantly, a good antimicrobial polymer should be broadly
									  and quickly biocidal, such that it can kill a wide range of
									  pathogenic microorganisms within a short time. If a polymer
									  only works when exposed to a pathogenic microorganism for
									  several days, then it is not very practically applicable.</p>
								  <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: 500">
									  Mechanical and chemical properties of polymers vary depending
									  on their composition and synthesis, which makes them widely
									  applicable across industries. Antimicrobial polymers specifically
									  are relevant in industries such as <a style="color: #6633ff" href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/bm061150q">water treatment, surface
									  disinfectants, biomedical implants, food preservation, and the
									  development of antimicrobial textiles.</a> In each industry,
									  polymer-based sterilization has several advantages over current
									  sterilization practices. One major advantage, common between
									  industries, is that antimicrobial polymers allow for self-sterilizing
									  materials, which enhances their durability and longevity.
									  Antimicrobial polymers can also be non-toxic and can avoid
									  producing toxic byproducts, resolving an issue with several
									  current disinfectants and water treatment procedures which leave
									  behind toxic residue.</p>
								  <blockquote style="font-size: 2em; line-height: 1.5em">Clothes could be made of antimicrobial textiles,
