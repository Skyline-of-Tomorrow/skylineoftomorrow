									My goal in life is to build a city in space. 
									</p>
									<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: 500">
									Without context, this statement is absurd. It feels like a quote from a 
									mediocre Bond villain.
									</p>
									<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: 500">
									But to me, a space city is a metaphor for a futurist vision
									of a city where technology and planning innovation makes possible
									a reality of material justice.
								        </p>
							                <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: 500">
								        The greatest injustices are realized materially. 
									Material injustices occur when as a direct result of disparities
									in political and economic power, material conditions surrounding
									someone’s life and their survival are of varying qualities, to
									the point that lower class status results in conditions threatening
									one’s ability to exist as a human and pursue fulfilling goals.
									Material injustice is when, due to disparities in income, one
									must live in an older building not constructed up to modern codes,
									which floods during the spring, causing damage to a persons’
									home and incurring random costs which set back one’s ability
									to pursue their goals. Material injustice is when due to racial
									and class segregation one must live in an area where the nearest
									grocery store is over 40 minutes’ drive away, resulting in health
									disparities due to poor food quality in the vicinity, which in
									turn affect one’s ability to live life on their own terms.
									Material injustice is when immigrant communities across Europe
									move into ghettos which lack heating and electricity, affecting
									education and causing health issues, forcing a cycle of perpetual
									poverty.</p>
									<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: 500">
									The centrality of material injustice to the perpetuation of
									cycles of injustice does not deny its systemic nature. The
									carceral system and obstacles inherent within systems such as
									higher education and privatized medicine actively work to
									maintain disparities in power by relegating people to classes
									where material conditions perpetuate these cycles. However,
									once these systemic apparatuses are dismantled the question of
									the material reality of the built environment remains.  Attempting
									to facilitate material progress through technological innovation
									has rightfully come under criticism in the past. Scientific
									progress has frequently been used as a cover or justification
									for human rights abuses. Critics have pointed out that the
									assumptions that underly certain scientific experimentation
									have derived from racist knowledge systems. Valid criticism
									has also pointed out how historic advancements in science have
									ignored ethical considerations and failed to account for the
									negative externalities of experimental results. In the words
									of fictional mathematician Ian Malcolm, “Your scientists were
									so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn’t stop
									to think if they should.”
									</p>
									<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: 500">
									These criticisms should be understood not as anti-science, but
									as constructive wariness towards a discipline that too frequently
									has furthered the interests of powerful parties against the
									little man. To frame these criticisms as anti-science is dangerous
									as it would abandon the terrain of technical expertise to elite
									interests vested in maintaining material injustice. In a system
									constructed with barriers to keep the lower class from achieving
									the technical expertise necessary to make themselves independent
									of elite interests, it is imperative that technical expertise
									not be abandoned in favor of more theoretical and politically
									focused means of resistance to material injustice.
									</p>
									<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: 500">
									I believe the solution only partly lies in dismantling the
									epistemic origins of certain scientific pretenses. To entirely
									leave the discussion over the moral and political implications
									of technological innovation to the realm of moral philosophers
									and social theorists would be irresponsible as it would abandon
									the obligation we have to use technological innovation towards
									a humanitarian end and resolve instances of material suffering.
									I believe that instead of an approach towards technological
									innovation involving solely a dissection of the origins of
									modern innovation, it is important that advancements be made
									towards a revolutionary humanitarian technology.
									</p>
									<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: 500">
									Revolutionary humanitarian technology is a field established
									in contrast to mainstream portrayals of technological advancement.
									In contrast to entrepreneurial technology like SpaceX, Tesla,
									Google Glass, or iPhones, revolutionary humanitarian technology
									aims to develop technological innovations to resolve immediately
									pressing material injustices without the end goal of profit.
									It aims to advance technology for the immediate use by communities
									in need. It reimagines scientific advancement as the procurement
									of new tools to allow people to live outside of material injustice
									and pursue a fulfilling life.
									</p>
									<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: 500">
									An area of exploration for the use of revolutionary humanitarian
									technology is within the discipline of civil engineering and
									architecture. The built environment can have a direct effect on
									breaking the cycle of material injustice. Building expertise
									within communities to advance technological innovation is
									imperative in a world where political systems fail daily. When
									lead pipes cannot be replaced due to bureaucratic barriers, a
									revolutionary approach could be to explore using innovations
									by technical experts within a community to efficiently filter
									and purify the water. When environmental destruction could cause
									desertification within a community leaving residents without
									necessary resources for survival, innovations in recycling
									technology and sustainable materials that lead to the development
									of a circular economy could prevent further ecological harm.
									Materials innovations could help conserve energy through capturing
									heat within buildings, sustainable energy could eliminate greenhouse
									gas emissions preventing the worst effects of climate change,
									and innovative water capture mechanisms could provide communities
									in arid regions with sustainable local water sources. These
									technological advancements fall under the umbrella of revolutionary
									humanitarian technology and offer a realm of possibility for
									scientific progress outside of fascist or corporate interests.
									</p>
									<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: 500">
									These advancements are what I am talking about when I reference
									the idea of building a city in space. A city in space is a vision
									of a world where material injustice is resolved via not only
									the destruction of political systems of injustice, but also
									through the incorporate of technological innovations in our day
									to day life which give people access to clean water, sustainable
									energy, and sustainable materials, allowing all of us to pursue
									our own fulfilling goals.
									</p>
									<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: 500">
									Futurism can be revolutionary. To imagine a future that resolves 
									the injustices of the present is the hopeful vision that should 
									drive humanitarian action. However, it is one thing to just picture 
									this future. To act and move in the right direction, there must be a 
									plan. A plan that is actionable will inevitably draw upon technical 
									expertise and engineering.</p>
									<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: 500">
									It is with this goal in mind that I have decided to set up this
									website, The Skyline of Tomorrow. I aim to explore, through
									writing and technical modeling, new advancements in technology
									and their potential humanitarian applications in the field of urbanism. I hope to use
									my background in material science and sustainable urbanism
									to create a hyper-realistic vision of a possible future. A
									future where innovations in technology can be applied to alleviate
									material injustice and achieve new urban production systems
									that are not geared towards promoting elite power.</p>
