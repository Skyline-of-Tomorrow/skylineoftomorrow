									Transitioning away from fossil fuels is integral to creating a
									more environmentally sustainable future. Although implementing
									mass public transit is the most efficient way to ensure a reduction
									in greenhouse gas emissions, transitioning automobiles away from
									traditional gasoline can serve as an intermediate step towards
									reducing overall fossil fuel consumption. Assessing the location
									of alternative fuel sources in relation to various parts of the
									city could serve to better identify patterns emerging in who
									gets to participate in sustainable environmental practices.
									This report looks at the locations of alternative fuel sources
									throughout Chicago. The three measurements used to analyze alternative
									fuel access were the locations of Alternative Fuel Sources and
									the variations in permission to access the Alternative Fuel
									Sources (Private versus Public access). These indicators were
									then compared against the variations in per capita income
									throughout Chicago. All data was obtained via the Chicago Data
									Portal and the Chicago Health Atlas.</p>
								  <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: 500">
									A first glance of alternative vehicle fuel sources throughout
									Chicago will reveal an easy to spot spatial dependence of
									alternative fuel sources (AFS) <a href="#figure1">[Fig 1]</a>. There tends to be a
									concentration of alternative fuel throughout the loop and a
									greater number of AFS sites on the north side than on the south
									side; however, the variation in degree of access to AFS sites
									outside the loop is not as apparent, such that visually it is
									hard to determine if there is a greater degree of access to AFS
									sites in Rogers Park than in McKinley Park. Through a further
									analysis of variables it becomes more obvious the disparity in
									access to AFS sites throughout the south and west side of Chicago,
									as access to AFS sites in certain south and west side community
									areas is limited entirely to private and government-only AFS
									sites <a href="#figure2">[Fig 2]</a>. The disparity in access is less obvious when AFS
									sites are measured through a point in grid density analysis as
									communities throughout the north and south side have comparable
									site density, contrasted with the high density of site locations
									in the loop and near west loop <a href="#figure3">[Fig 3]</a>. The point in grid
									analysis uses a spatial unit too small to really identify the
									distinction in density between out of loop communities. At larger
									grid units the ability to draw conclusive data about AFS site
									distribution is made more difficult as the scale becomes too
									large. A Kernel Density Estimate helps to better visualize the
									degree of density variation between communities outside of the
									Loop <a href="#figure4">[Fig 4]</a>. It reveals the greater degree of density on the
									North side versus the south side. The weighted values assigned
									to AFS sites in the KDE analysis creates a more realistic analysis
									as AFS sites will inevitably be rarer than regular gas stations
									in the current economy and thus AFS sites will pull in drivers
									from over a greater radius than that of traditional gas stations,
									thus the weighted values. It becomes more accurate to use a
									KDE analysis as it indicates the degree of separation between
									successive AFS sites versus in the point in grid analysis which
									isolates AFS sites to quadrants.</p>
									<blockquote style="font-size: 2em; line-height: 1.5em">the effects
									of climate change are felt a disparate levels between communities,
									and distribution of sustainable innovations and disaster
									prevention is unequal and frequently
									leaves under-served communities at risk.</blockquote>
									<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: 500">
								  To provide context for the disparate levels of access to AFS
									sites throughout Chicago a chloropleth map of per capita income
									throughout Chicago neighborhoods was compared to the prior point
									data analyses of AFS site density throughout the city <a href="#figure1">[Fig 1]</a>.
									Per capita income was used as an indicator of economic disparities
									as it was assumed that higher levels of per capita income could
									correlate with better qualities of living and increased political
									connection as communities with easily accessible aldermen tend
									to receive greater attention in Chicago, resulting in enhanced
									qualities of living and access to beneficial services which can
									contribute ultimately to higher per capita incomes. Per capita
									income was evaluated instead of gross income to control for
									family size and distribution of wealth over larger numbers of
									people. Alternative variables for assessing political power,
									economic power, class status, and quality of life exist and can
									better control for confounding variables to draw more conclusive
									results, but I felt comparing AFS sites with per capita income
									could begin to create a picture that lead to further questioning.
									The north side and areas near to the loop, especially the near
									north side and near west loop, have a higher per capita income
									than most of Chicago, especially in contrast with the south and
									west side of Chicago <a href="figure1">[Fig 1]</a>. The per capita income levels
									helped to indicate the degree of economic disparity throughout
									Chicago and made apparent a spatial correlation between increased
									levels of alternative fuel access and increased per capita income.
									Although it becomes a possibility that population density may
									confound a causative conclusion. The Near West Loop neighborhood
									was most interesting to analyze as visually it appeared to be
									a point where the spatial density of the Loopâ€™s AFS sites begins
									to taper off to more match the density (as defined by the point
									in grid analysis) of the north and south side <a href="#figure5">[Fig 5]</a>. However,
									upon using a KDE analysis it became obvious that the Near West
									Loop had a level of access to AFS sites comparable to that of the
									Loop, where most sites were located <a href="#figure6">[Fig 6]</a>. Conclusions cannot be
									drawn specifically attributing the concentration of AFS sites to the
									higher income level of the Near West Loop neighborhood as
									confounding factors such as the fact that the loop is a large
									tourism and commercial area in Chicago could explain the high
									density of alternative fuel sites. As well neighborhoods of
									comparable per capita income as the Near West Loop such as
									Edison Park and Mount Greenwood did not have nearly the density
									of alternative fuel sites as the Near West Loop, suggesting
									other explanations for alternative fuel site locations <a href="#figure1">[Fig. 1 & 2]</a>.
									Proximity to the loop may better explain the increasing density
									of AFS sites in certain neighborhoods. However, this would fail
									to explain the northward skew of the AFS site density distribution
									as apparent in the KDE map <a href="#figure4">[Fig. 4]</a>. It should be noted that
									visually the neighborhoods with higher per capita income appear
									to have significantly more AFS sites or at least are in closer
									access to an AFS site, emphasized by the gap in access depicted
									in the KDE analysis between neighborhoods such as Brighton Park
									and Englewood <a href="#figure4">[Fig. 4]</a>. Despite closer proximity to the loop,
									Englewood and neighboring areas such as Gage Park and Chicago
									Lawn lack access to alternative fuel sites in comparison to
									neighborhoods such as Garfield Ridge or Uptown, which have a
									higher density of AFS sites as indicated by the KDE map
									<a href="#figure1">[Fig. 1, 2, & 4]</a>. It is not conclusive to suggest per capita
									income as the explanatory factor for the distribution of AFS
									sites, as there could be other variables, but it is significant
									to note the density patterns in the maps below as the effects
									of climate change are felt a disparate levels between communities,
									and the distribution of sustainable innovations and disaster
									prevention is unequal and frequently leaves under-served
									communities at risk.</p>
